    Johannes Erigena, surnamed Scotus, a man renowned for Learning,
    sitting at the Table in respect of his Learning with Charles the
    Bauld, Emperour [sic] and King of France, behaved himself as a slovenly
    Scholar, nothing courtly; whereupon the Emperour asked him merrily,
    "Quid interest inter Scotum et Sotum" - "Whats the difference between
    a Scot and a Sot?" He merrily, but malapertly answered, "Mensa", "The
    Table", as though the Emperour were the Sot and he the Scot.

    into a hound by the enchantment of a woman of the Fairy Folk, who
    loved Tyren's husband Ullan; and the two hounds of Finn were the
    children of Tyren, born to her in that shape. Of all hounds in Ireland
    they were the best, and Finn loved them much, so that it was said that
    he wept but twice in his life, and once was for the death of Bran.

      On the first of May in the herds[men] of every village hold their Beltein ... They make a fire of wood,
      on which they dress a large caudle of eggs, butter, oatmeal and milk; and bring ... plenty of beer
      and whiskey, for each of the company must contribute something. The rites begin with spilling some
      of the caudle on the ground, by way of libation; on that every one takes a cake of oatmeal, upon which
      are raised nine square knobs, each dedicated to some particular being, the supposed preserver of their
      flocks and herds, or to some particular animal the real destroyer of them; each person then turns his
      face to the fire, breaks off a knob and flinging it over his shoulder, says "This I give to thee,
      preserve thou my horses; this to thee, preserve thou my sheep" and so on. After that they use the
      same ceremony to the noxious animals. "This I give to thee, O fox! spare thou my lambs; this to thee,
      O hooded-crow! and this to thee, O eagle!"

    The night before, all the fires in the country were carefully extinguished, and next morning the materials for exciting this sacred fire were prepared. The most primitive method seems to be that which was used in the islands of Skye, Mull, and Tiree. A well-seasoned plank of oak was procured, in the midst of which a hole was bored. A wimble of the same timber was then applied, the end of which they fitted to the hole. But in some parts of the mainland the machinery was different. They used a frame of green wood, of a square form, in the centre of which was an axle-tree. In some places three times three persons, in others three times nine, were required for turning round by turns the axle-tree or wimble. If any of them had been guilty of murder, adultery, theft, or other atrocious crime, it was imagined either that the fire would not kindle, or that it would be devoid of its usual virtue. So soon as any sparks were emitted by means of the violent friction, they applied a species of agaric which grows on old birch-trees, and is very combustible. This fire had the appearance of being immediately derived from heaven, and manifold were the virtues ascribed to it. They esteemed it a preservative against witch-craft, and a sovereign remedy against malignant diseases, both in the human species and in cattle; and by it the strongest poisons were supposed to have their nature changed.

    After kindling the bonfire with the tein-eigin the company prepared their victuals. And as soon as they had finished their meal, they amused themselves a while in singing and dancing round the fire. Towards the close of the entertainment, the person who officiated as master of the feast produced a large cake baked with eggs and scalloped round the edge, called am bonnach bea-tine—i.e., the Beltane cake. It was divided into a number of pieces, and distributed in great form to the company. There was one particular piece which whoever got was called cailleach beal-tine—i.e., the Beltane carline, a term of great reproach. Upon his being known, part of the company laid hold of him and made a show of putting him into the fire; but the majority interposing, he was rescued. And in some places they laid him flat on the ground, making as if they would quarter him. Afterwards, he was pelted with egg-shells, and retained the odious appellation during the whole year. And while the feast was fresh in people’s memory, they affected to speak of the cailleach beal-tine as dead.

    If the good housewife perceives the effect of the malicious on any of her kind, she takes as much milk as she can drain from the enchanted herd, for the witch commonly leaves very little. She then boils it with certain herbs and adds to them flints and untempered steel; after she secures the door, and invokes the three sacred persons. This puts the witch into such and agony, that she comes nilling-willing to the house, begs to be admitted, to obtain relief by touching the powerful pot; the good woman then makes her terms; the witch restores the milk t the cattle and in return is freed from her pains.

    Brochwel Yscythrog, Prince of Powys, being one day a hare hunting, pursued his game till he came to a great thicket; when he was amazed to find a virgin of surpassing beauty, engaged in deep devotion, with the hare he had been pursuing under her robe, boldly facing the dogs, who retired to a distance howling, notwithstanding all the efforts of the sportsmen to make them seize their prey. Even when the huntsman blew his horn, it stuck to his lips. Brochwel heard her story, and gave to God and her a parcel of lands, to be a sanctuary to all that fled there. He desired her to found an abbey on the spot. She did so, and died abbess at a good old age. She was buried in the neighbouring church, called Pennant, and from, her distinguished by the addition of Melangell. Her hard bed is shown in the cleft of a neighbouring rock. Her tomb was in a little chapel, or oratory, adjoining to the church, and now used as a vestry room. This room is still called 'Cell-y-bedd' or the Cell of the Grave. Her reliques as well as her image have been long since removed; but I think the last is still to be seen in the churchyard. The legend is perpetuated by some rude wooden carving of the Saint, with numbers of hares scuttling to her for protection. She properly became their Patroness. They were called 'Oen Melangell' (St. Monacella's Lambs).

Pishogue is a white, yellowish fungus made at dead of night, after a solemn incantation of the devil according to a secret rite which has been handed down from generation to generation ... In the cool, trim dairy, upon the post of the door, I saw daubs of pishogue. My host ... informed me under his breath that he might expect bad luck with the dairy, as it was indeed the cursed pishogue. That very evening ... his twenty splendid milch cows ... were absolutely dry, and for months they remained so, while a tenant who was noticed to give up his weekly attendance at mass, his dairy stock suddenly too on the appearance of well-fed cattle. Everyone knew he was the man who had put pishogue on his master.

The dance is somewhat like that of the Country Bumpkin; and in the course of it, some one of the more active exhibits a kind o somerset [summersault] with the aid of two others. They are attended by Jack and Gill, or as they are called in Wales, the Fool and Megen. The fool is the same as the clown of the old comedy; the Megen, a man dressed in women's clothes, with the face smutted to represent a hag. Both entertain the mob by ridiculous tricks; the Megen generally solicits contributions from the spectators, and keeps off the crow by the dread blows of her ladle.

    The Druids - for so their magicians are called - held nothing more sacred than the mistletoe and the tree that bears it, always supposing that tree to be the oak. But they choose groves of oaks for the sake of the tree alone, and they never perform any of their rites except in the presence of a branch of it; so that it seems probable that the priests themselves may derive their name from the Greek word for that tree.* In fact, they think that everything that grows on it has been sent from heaven and is a proof that the tree was chosen by the god himself.

    Opposite the coast of Celtic Gaul there is an island in the ocean, not smaller than Sicily, lying to the north which is inhabited by the Hyperboreans, who are so named because they dwell beyond the North Wind. Tradition says that Latona was born there and for that reason the inhabitants venerate Apollo more than any other god. They are, in manner, his priests, for they daily celebrate him with continual songs of praise and pay him abundant honours. In this island there is a magnificent grove or precinct of Apollo, and a remarkable temple of a round form, adorned with many consecrated gifts. There is also a city sacred to the god, most of the inhabitants of which are harpers, who continually play upon their harps in this temple.

Accordingly, exactly at midnight, the Fires began to appear; and taking the advantage of going up to the leads of the house which had a widely extended view, I saw on a radius of thirty miles all around, the Fires burning on every eminence which the country afforded. I had farther satisfaction in learning, from and undoubted authority, that the people danced round the Fires, and at the close went through these fires, and made their sons and daughters, together with their cattle, pass through the Fire, and the whole was conducted with religious solemnity.

    A stock, a spade, an axe in the hand

    a spectacle rarely now seen in Europe. In most of the chief streets,
    as the summer twilight waned, large bonfires were lighted, and also
    tar barrels. The Cornish custom of waving torches, i.e. blazing
    masses of rope dipped in tar and hung from and iron chain, was
    extensively celebrated. Te directors of the fire festival,
    dressed in hunter's red coats and leathern gauntlets,
    went among the group wth squibs and roman candles.

    In most parts of Wales, and throughout all Scotland, and in Cornwall, we find it a common opinion of the vulgar, that about Midsummer-eve... it is usually for snakes to meet in companies, and that by joyning heads together and hissing, a kind of bubble is formed, which the rest, by continual hissing, blow on till it passes quite through the body, and then it immediately hardens, and resembles a glass-ring, which whoever finds ( as some old women are persuaded) shall prosper in all his undertakings. The Rings thus generated, are called Gleinau Nadroeth; in English, Snake-Stones. They are small glass amulets, commonly about half as wide as our finger-rings, but much thicker, and of a green colour usually, though sometime blue, and waved with red and white.

If a dog attacks any person to tear him, and that person kill the dog with a weapon, there is no fine. If a dog bites a person so that blood flows, let the dog's owner pay for the blood: but if a bitten person kill the dog, he will only get sixteen pence. If a notorious dog tears a person on three occasions, it must be killed by their owner; if not, it must be tied to the owner's foot, two spans away from him, and so killed, and let him pay three cows fine to the King.

    year; and this spot, which was supposed to be dedicated to Satan, was styled "the
    Good Man's Croft", that is to say, the landlord's acre. Some pagan ceremony probably

    Animals were known to be offered by Irish and Scotch down to the last century, and it is recorded that a calf was publicly burnt in 1800 by Cornishmen to stop a murrain. A sheep was sometimes offered for the like purpose in some parts of England. In 1678 four men were tried "for sacrificing a bull in a heathenish manner in the Island of St. Ruffus—for the recovery of health of Cirstane Mackenzie." Animals were also killed in honour of St. Martin's day.

    All the legends of porcine animals, which abound in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, had reference to the suppression of a form of idolatry, analogous to, if not identical with, the existing worship of the Hindoo deity, Vishnu, in his Avatar as a Boar.

    It was commonly said in Ireland that bull's blood was used in mixing the
      mortar for castles. There certainly seem to have been animal sacrifices
      under the sites of buildings, either to assuage the feelings of the
      displaced spirit of the site, or to provide a guardian spirit for the
      house. One explanation, however, for the burial of horse skulls found
      under floors and in walls is that they gave the room a resonant sound
      for dancing.

    straight, neck-like thing as tall as my mast. It was not a sea-serpent,
    but a much larger and more substantial bast, something in the nature of
    a giant lizard, I should think.

    In this Hyperborean country [Skye] in every district, there is to be met with a rude stone consecrated to Gruagach or Apollo. The first who is done with his reaping send a man or a maiden with a bundle of Corn to his next neighbour, who has not yet reaped down his Harvest, who when he finished, dispatches to his own next neighbour, who is behind in his work and so on until the whole corns are cut down. This sheaf is called the Cripple Goat, or Gaobhir Bhacagh, and is at present meant as a brag or affront to the farmer, to being more remiss, or later than the others at reaping the harvest, for which reason the bearer of it must make as good a pair of heels, for fear of being ill-used for his indiscretion, as he can. Whether the appellation of Cripple Goat may have any or the least adherence to apollonian Altar of Goats Horns, I shall not pretend to determine.

The Day of St Michael is the day of early mass, the sacrificial lamb; the oblation struan; the distribution of the lamb; of pilgrimage to the burial ground of their fathers; the day of giving and receiving carrots with their wishes and acknowledgements, and the day of athletics and racing horses.

    A lady lecturing recently on the #Irish language drew attention to the fact (I mentioned it myself as long ago as 1925)
    that, while the average English speaker gets along with a mere 400 words, the Irish-speaking peasant uses 4,000. Considering
    what most #English speakers can achieve with their tiny fund of noises, it is a nice speculation to what extremity one would be
    reduced if one were locked up for a day with and Irish-speaking bore and bereft of all means of committing murder or suicide. ...
    My point, however, is this. The 400/4,000 ration is fallacious; 400/400,000 would be more like it.

    At Séguret, in Provence, there survives the depiction of the Celtic 'father
    of the gods' accompanied by an oak tree. Some 150 stone monuments have been
    found honoring the Celtic 'father of the gods' in Gaul, such as the one at
    Hausen-an-der-Zaber. Each depicts a tree adorned with oak leaves and acorns.

    Some authors claim that philosophy originated among the barbarians: thus
    Aristotle, in the treatise on Magic, and Sotion, in the twenty-third book of
    the Succession of the Philosophers, say that it was cultivated among the
    Persians by the Magi, among the Babylonians or the Assyrians by the
    Chaldeans, in India by the gymnosophists, among the Celts and the Gauls by
    those who were called Druids and Semnotheoi [god-talkers].

    Flavius Arrianus... confirms that the Galatian capital was Drunemeton, 'oak
    sanctuary', where twelve chieftains (tetrarchs) met annually with three
    hundred elected delegates, which formed the government of the Galatians. At
    Drunemeton, he says, they worshiped their equivalent of Artemis. It has been
    argued that the closed parallel to Artemis, daughter of Zeus and twin sister
    of Apollo, was Brigit, 'the exalted one', daughter of The Dagda.

    The relation of the Celts to the Druids is quite different from that of
    conquerors, who occasionally resort to the medicine men of the conquered
    folk because they have stronger magic or greater influence with the
    autochthonous gods.

    The Indo-European origin of #Irish meters, and the striking similarities
    between the #Hindu and Irish systems of law, which also point to
    Indo-European origin, go a long way towards proving that the Irish filid, and
    therefore the Celtic #Druids, were heres to the same tradition as Brahmins.

    Among all the tribes, generally speaking, there are three classes of men
    held in special honor: the Bards, the Vates and the Druids. The Bards are
    singers and poets; the Vates interpreters of sacrifice and natural philosophers;
    the Druids, in addition to the science of nature, study also moral
    philosophy. They are believed to be the most just of men, and are therefore
    entrust with the decision of cases affecting either individuals or the public;
    indeed in former times they arbitrated in war and brought to a standstill
    the opponents when about to draw up in line of battle; and murder cases have
    been mostly entrusted to their decision... These men, as well as other
    authorities, have pronounced that men's souls an the universe are
    indestructible, although at times fire or water may (temporarily) prevail.

    They have also certain philosophers and theologians who are treated with
    special honour, whom they call Druids. They further make use of seers,
    think them worthy of praise. These latter by their augural observances and by
    the sacrifice of sacrificial animals can foretell the future and they hold
    the people subject to them. In particular when inquiring into matters of
    great import they have a strange and incredible custom; they devote to
    death a human being  and stab him with a dagger in the region above the
    diaphragm, and when he has fallen they foretell the future from his fall, and
    from the convulsions of his limbs and, moreover from the spurting of the
    blood, placing their trust in some ancient and long continued observation o
    these practices. Their custom is that no on should offer sacrifice without a
    Druid: for they say that thanks should be offered to the gods by those
    skilled in the divine nature, as though they were people who can speak their
    language, and through them also they hold that beneits should be asked.

    The highlanders for a sort of almanac of presage of the weather for the ensuing year in the following manner. They make observation on twelve days, beginning at the last of December, and hold as an infallible rule that whatsoever weather happens on each of those days, the same will prove to agree in the correspondent months. Thus, January is to answer to the weather of December the 31st, February to that of January 1st; and so with the rest. Old people still pay great attention to this augury.

The tine miners would leave their work, set up a pitcher full of water, pelt it with stones until it was broken and then go to and inn, ... refill a fresh pitcher with ale ... in revelry.
