On the first of May in the herds[men] of every village hold their Beltein ... They make a fire of wood, 
      on which they dress a large caudle of eggs, butter, oatmeal and milk; and bring ... plenty of beer 
      and whiskey, for each of the company must contribute something The rites begin with spilling some 
      of the caudle on the ground, by way of libation; on that every one takes a cake of oatmeal, upon which 
      are raised nine square knobs, each dedicated to some particular being, the supposed preserver of their 
      flocks and herds, or to some particular animal the real destroyer of them; each person then turns his 
      face to the fire, breaks off a knob and flinging it over his shoulder, says "This I give to thee, 
      preserve thou my horses; this to thee, preserve thou my sheep" and so on. After that they use the 
      same ceremony to the noxious animals. "This I give to thee, O fox! spare thou my lambs; this to thee, 
      O hooded-crow! and this to thee, O eagle!"
