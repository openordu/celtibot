    Johannes Erigena, surnamed Scotus, a man renowned for Learning,
    sitting at the Table in respect of his Learning with Charles the
    Bauld, Emperour [sic] and King of France, behaved himself as a slovenly
    Scholar, nothing courtly; whereupon the Emperour asked him merrily,
    "Quid interest inter Scotum et Sotum" - "Whats the difference between
    a Scot and a Sot?" He merrily, but malapertly answered, "Mensa", "The
    Table", as though the Emperour were the Sot and he the Scot.

    for Tyren, sister to Murna,the mother of Finn, had been changed
    into a hound by the enchantment of a woman of the Fairy Folk, who
    loved Tyren's husband Ullan; and the two hounds of Finn were the
    children of Tyren, born to her in that shape. Of all hounds in Ireland
    they were the best, and Finn loved them much, so that it was said that
    he wept but twice in his life, and once was for the death of Bran.

      On the first of May in the herds[men] of every village hold their Beltein ... They make a fire of wood,
      on which they dress a large caudle of eggs, butter, oatmeal and milk; and bring ... plenty of beer
      and whiskey, for each of the company must contribute something. The rites begin with spilling some
      of the caudle on the ground, by way of libation; on that every one takes a cake of oatmeal, upon which
      are raised nine square knobs, each dedicated to some particular being, the supposed preserver of their
      flocks and herds, or to some particular animal the real destroyer of them; each person then turns his
      face to the fire, breaks off a knob and flinging it over his shoulder, says "This I give to thee,
      preserve thou my horses; this to thee, preserve thou my sheep" and so on. After that they use the
      same ceremony to the noxious animals. "This I give to thee, O fox! spare thou my lambs; this to thee,
      O hooded-crow! and this to thee, O eagle!"

    The night before, all the fires in the country were carefully extinguished, and next morning the
    materials for exciting this sacred fire were prepared. The most primitive method seems to be that
    which was used in the islands of Skye, Mull, and Tiree. A well-seasoned plank of oak was procured,
    in the midst of which a hole was bored. A wimble of the same timber was then applied, the end of
    which they fitted to the hole. But in some parts of the mainland the machinery was different. They
    used a frame of green wood, of a square form, in the centre of which was an axle-tree. In some
    places three times three persons, in others three times nine, were required for turning round
    by turns the axle-tree or wimble. If any of them had been guilty of murder, adultery, theft,
    or other atrocious crime, it was imagined either that the fire would not kindle, or that it
    would be devoid of its usual virtue. So soon as any sparks were emitted by means of the violent
    friction, they applied a species of agaric which grows on old birch-trees, and is very combustible.
    This fire had the appearance of being immediately derived from heaven, and manifold were the virtues
    ascribed to it. They esteemed it a preservative against witch-craft, and a sovereign remedy against
    malignant diseases, both in the human species and in cattle; and by it the strongest poisons were
    supposed to have their nature changed.

    After kindling the bonfire with the tein-eigin the company prepared their victuals. And as soon
    as they had finished their meal, they amused themselves a while in singing and dancing round the
    fire. Towards the close of the entertainment, the person who officiated as master of the feast
    produced a large cake baked with eggs and scalloped round the edge, called am bonnach bea-tine—i.e.,
    the Beltane cake. It was divided into a number of pieces, and distributed in great form to the company.
    There was one particular piece which whoever got was called cailleach beal-tine—i.e., the Beltane carline,
    a term of great reproach. Upon his being known, part of the company laid hold of him and made a show of putting
    him into the fire; but the majority interposing, he was rescued. And in some places they laid him flat on the ground,
    making as if they would quarter him. Afterwards, he was pelted with egg-shells, and retained the odious
    appellation during the whole year. And while the feast was fresh in people’s memory, they affected to
    speak of the cailleach beal-tine as dead.

    Brochwel Yscythrog, Prince of Powys, being one day a hare hunting, pursued his
    game till he came to a great thicket; when he was amazed to find a virgin of
    surpassing beauty, engaged in deep devotion, with the hare he had been pursuing
    under her robe, boldly facing the dogs, who retired to a distance howling,
    notwithstanding all the efforts of the sportsmen to make them seize their
    prey. Even when the huntsman blew his horn, it stuck to his lips.
    Brochwel heard her story, and gave to God and her a parcel of lands, to be a
    sanctuary to all that fled there. He desired her to found an abbey on the spot.
    She did so, and died abbess at a good old age. She was buried in the neighbouring
    church, called Pennant, and from, her distinguished by the addition of Melangell.
    Her hard bed is shown in the cleft of a neighbouring rock. Her tomb was in a little
    chapel, or oratory, adjoining to the church, and now used as a vestry room. This
    room is still called 'Cell-y-bedd' or the Cell of the Grave. Her reliques as well
    as her image have been long since removed; but I think the last is still to be seen
    in the churchyard. The legend is perpetuated by some rude wooden carving of the Saint,
    with numbers of hares scuttling to her for protection. She properly became their Patroness.
    They were called 'Oen Melangell' (St. Monacella's Lambs).

      pishogue. That very evening ... his twenty splendid milch cows ... were absolutely dry,

    The Druids - for so their magicians are called - held nothing more sacred than the mistletoe and the tree that bears it,
    always supposing that tree to be the oak. But they choose groves of oaks for the sake of the tree alone, and they never
    perform any of their rites except in the presence of a branch of it; so that it seems probable that the priests
    themselves may derive their name from the Greek word for that tree.* In fact, they think that everything that grows
    on it has been sent from heaven and is a proof that the tree was chosen by the god himself.

    Opposite the coast of Celtic Gaul there is an island in the ocean, not smaller than Sicily, lying to the north which
    is inhabited by the Hyperboreans, who are so named because they dwell beyond the North Wind. Tradition says that 
    Latona was born there and for that reason the inhabitants venerate Apollo more than any other god. They are, 
    in manner, his priests, for they daily celebrate him with continual songs of praise and pay him abundant honours. 
    In this island there is a magnificent grove or precinct of Apollo, and a remarkable temple of a round form, 
    adorned with many consecrated gifts. There is also a city sacred to the god, most of the inhabitants of 
    which are harpers, who continually play upon their harps in this temple.

    the country afforded. I had farther satisfaction in learning, from and undoubted

    Some used after #Midsummer Day is past, to hang it [orpine] it up over their chamber
    doors, or upon the walls, which will be fresh and green at Christmas ... with this
    persuasion that they that hanged in up, shall eel no disease so long as it abideth green.

    Take orpines [heal-all], bastard balm, small burdock, stinging goose-foot, pimpernel, water avens and the ashes
    of a stag's horns, boil them in red wine, strain, and drink it daily until it is finished. being
    restrained by this potion, the blood will habitually be diverted to the hights and ankles.

    I am Taliesin, I sing perfect meter,
    My original country is the Land of the #Summer Stars...
    I was with my Lord in the highest sphere
    When Lucifer fell to the depths of Hell...
    I have borne a standard before Alexander,
    I know the names of the stars from north to south,
    I have been a blue salmon
    A #dog, a #stag, a #buck on the mountain
    A stock, a spade, an axe in the hand
    A #stallion, a #bull, a #roebuck
    A #grain which grew on the hill
    I was reaped an cast in an oven
    I have been dead, I have been alive
    I am Taliesin.

    The Fire Festivals of Beltane, Halloween, Midsummer and Yule had this
    in common: they were all purificatory, designed to purge air and earth
    and sky of unclean and hostile influences... In later times, at least,
    witches are the enemy against whom the sacred fire is directed.

    The highlanders for a sort of almanac of presage of the weather for the
    ensuing year in the following manner. They make observation on twelve days,
    beginning at the last of December, and hold as an infallible rule that
    whatsoever weather happens on each of those days, the same will prove to
    agree in the correspondent months. Thus, January is to answer to the
    weather of December the 31st, February to that of January 1st; and so with
    the rest. Old people still pay great attention to this augury.

    The Epiphany is Gwyl Ystwyll, or Yr Ystwyll. Ystwyll is simply the

    in the Welsh Prayer Book by the alternative title Seren Wyl, "Star
    Festival". The name Festum Stella was peculiar to the Celtic Church.

    An old custom used to prevail on St Paul's Pitcher day, as St Paul's Eve was called in Cornwall.
    The tine miners would leave their work, set up a pitcher full of water, pelt it with stones until
    it was broken and then go to and inn, ... refill a fresh pitcher with ale ... in revelry.
    As late as the year 1859, the boys of Bodmin used to parade the town with pitchers, which they
    threw into every open doorway, shouting the words "Paul's Eve and here's a heave".

    missing by sunset. He came to an ant-hill and enlisted the sympathies of the
