    On New Year's Day a game of football or shinty was played 
    in the Highlands by one parish against the next, and no 
    confines of pitch were observed. The match would begin 
    at the parish bounds and continue into darkness or a free fight.

    The Fire Festivals of Beltane, Halloween, Midsummer and Yule had this 
    in common: they were all purificatory, designed to purge air and earth 
    and sky of unclean and hostile influences... In later times, at least, 
    witches are the enemy against whom the sacred fire is directed.

    The highlanders for a sort of almanac of presage of the weather for the 
    ensuing year in the following manner. They make observation on twelve days, 
    beginning at the last of December, and hold as an infallible rule that 
    whatsoever weather happens on each of those days, the same will prove to 
    agree in the correspondent months. Thus, January is to answer to the 
    weather of December the 31st, February to that of January 1st; and so with 
    the rest. Old people still pay great attention to this augury.

    The Epiphany is Gwyl Ystwyll, or Yr Ystwyll. Ystwyll is simply the 
    Latin stella [in Welsh], but being an uncommon word it is explained 
    in the Welsh Prayer Book by the alternative title Seren Wyl, "Star 
    Festival". The name Festum Stella was peculiar to the Celtic Church.

    An old custom used to prevail on St Paul's Pitcher day, as St Paul's Eve was called in Cornwall. 
    The tine miners would leave their work, set up a pitcher full of water, pelt it with stones until 
    it was broken and then go to and inn, ... refill a fresh pitcher with ale ... in revelry.
    As late as the year 1859, the boys of Bodmin used to parade the town with pitchers, which they 
    threw into ever open doorway, shouting the words "Paul's Eve and here's a heave".
